ouroboros
=========

Ouroboros provides a platform to customize the Mongoose server to expose functionality specific to an embedded device for which a [configuration file](docs/configuration.md) given to the platform was written. The generation part of Ouroboros will be cross-platform, and the generated server software package should be runnable. The base business motivation of this system is to increase engineer efficiency by automating what is currently a manual process.
